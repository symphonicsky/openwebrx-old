Example DSP commands:
  * Compress I/Q data with FLAC:
    flac --force-raw-format --channels 2 --sample-rate=250000 --sign=unsigned --bps=8 --endian=little -o - -
  * Decompress FLAC-coded I/Q data:
    flac --force-raw-format --decode --endian=little --sign=unsigned - -

watchdog_interval=1.5

'''
If there's no input I/Q data after N seconds, input will be filled with zero samples, 
so that GNU Radio won't fail in openwebrx. It may reconnect rtl_tcp_tread. 
If watchdog_interval is 0, then watchdog thread is not started. 

'''

'''
	0 = drop samples
	1 = close client
	2 = openwebrx: don't care about that client until it wants samples again (gr-osmosdr bug workaround)
